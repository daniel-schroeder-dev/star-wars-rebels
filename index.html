    <h2>Leia Organa</h2>
    <p>Leia Skywalker Organa Solo, also known as Leia Organa for short, was a Force-sensitive human female political and military leader who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Imperial Era and the Resistance in the subsequent New Republic Era. Adopted into the House of Organa, the Alderaanian royal family, she was the Princess of Alderaan, a planet in the Core Worlds known for its dedication to pacifism. Organa was raised as the daughter of Senator Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, making her the heir to the Alderaanian monarchy. Instilled with the values of her adopted homeworld, Organa devoted her life to the restoration of democracy by opposing authoritarian regimes such as the Galactic Empire and the First Order.</p>
